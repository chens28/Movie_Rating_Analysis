# Movie_Rating_Analysis

This project seeks to demonstrate the essential skills involved in **Hypothesis Testing** [Part 1](https://github.com/chens28/Movie_Rating_Analysis/blob/main/Part1_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb) and **Machine Learning** [Part 2](https://github.com/chens28/Movie_Rating_Analysis/blob/main/Part2_Machine_Learning_Methods.ipynb). 

A real dataset that stems from a replication attempt of published research (Wallisch & Whritner, 
2017) is used. See the data set description below:

This dataset features ratings data of 400 movies from 1097 research participants. 
- 1st row: Headers (Movie titles/questions) â€“ note that the indexing in this list is from 1 Row 2-1098: Responses from individual participants
- Columns 1-400: These columns contain the ratings for the 400 movies (0 to 4, and missing)
- Columns 401-421: These columns contain self-assessments on sensation seeking behaviors (1-5)
- Columns 422-464: These columns contain responses to personality questions (1-5)
- Columns 465-474: These columns contain self-reported movie experience ratings (1-5)
- Column 475: Gender identity (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described)
